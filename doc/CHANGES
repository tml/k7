	- Added a doc/MODULES file to guide writing new modules
	- Integrated gritzko's libevent work

2009-05-10:

	Major:

	- No more toplevel primitves, just plain modules
    - 'ENV' was moved to 'system.k7.ENV', 'print' was moved to 'system.k7.shell'
	- K7 CPP core now only consists of a couple of primitive (setup, eval, exec, read, module)
	- Modules now need 'MODULE_NAME' and 'MODULE_STATIC' and 'MODULE' does not take any parameters

	Minor:

	- Moved functionality from 'k7/main.cpp' to the 'system.k7.shell' module
	- Updated modules to have { } in FUNCTION etc (useful for indentation in some editors)
	- Preliminary AS_PLUGIN compilation option to enable dynamic module registration
	- Modules JavaScript are now compiled in the build directory directly
	- K7 command-line parsing is delegated to the 'system.k7.shell.command' function
