The K7 project is architectured into three main components:

  - The module loading system: it provides functions to locate, load and unload
    both extension modules (C/C++ based extensions) and pure JavaScript modules.
    The module loading system has JavaScript bindings.

  - The interpreter: it is a simple user-friendly shell that makes it easy to
    run scripts and to have interactive editing.

  - The library: it is a collection of standalone modules (wether extension
    modules or pure JavaScript modules) that follow the conventions.

Module loading system
=====================

  The module loading system provides the following functions:

  - 'k7::LoadModule'    or 'core.lib.load'
  - 'k7::HasModule'     or 'core.lib.has'
  - 'k7::ModuleLoaded'  or 'core.lib.isLoaded'
  - 'k7::AddPath'       or 'core.lib.Path'
