== K7
== Writing Modules

Here are simple things to do:

1) Look at docs/API.yaml and think about where your module fits
2) Create your module directory like 'lib/full/name/of/MODULE'
3) Configure your editor to use tabs, with indentation size of 4
4) Create your 'MODULE.cpp' file using an existing module template
5) Create your 'MODULE.js' file if you have a JavaScript part to your module
6) Register your module in 'src/k7.cpp'
7) Updated the Makefile to add compilation of your module

To ease the development, have a look at other modules, read the 'README' document
and of course, have a look at the 'macros.h'.
